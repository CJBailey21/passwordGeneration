# passwordGeneration
After being provided with pre-made code for html and css, I was tasked to create the Javascript side of it to make a password generator with the choice to chose different criteria. Upon clicking the generate password button, prompts begin to appear on screen starting with the amount of characters that you would like to use with a minimum of 8 and a max of 128. Following that it asks would you like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters.
